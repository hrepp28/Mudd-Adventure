# Welcome to the Machine Shop! ðŸ”¨
The Machine shop has many tools used in engineering classes as well as just for fun! They have lathes, mills, the shop bot, and many other things for metalworking and woodworking!

`ls` only has a `machineshop.md` file, maybe try looking in McGregor for treasure! To move there you can use `cd`.
