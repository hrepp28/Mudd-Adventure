# Welcome to the Libra Complex!
The Libra Complex is a group of underground tunnels used to move around from some academic buildings as well as the Makerspace and Machine Shop! Be careful though, many frosh get lost or kidnapped by Wally the Wart who lives in the tunnels. 

`ls` showed `makerspace` and `mcgregor` in `libracomplex.md`
Use `cd` to move into one of the buildings and look for the treasure! 
I feel we are getting closer to the treasure!!
